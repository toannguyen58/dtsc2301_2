      <h2>Learning Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts</h2>
      <p class="date">January 2026</p>

      <p>
        Learning data science is not just about writing code or building models.
        It also involves understanding how data represents real people and real
        social systems. Many datasets reflect human behavior, social structures,
        and historical inequalities. Because of this, technical decisions made
        by data scientists can have meaningful social consequences.
      </p>

        When working with data about people, responsibility becomes an important
        concern. Data can be biased, incomplete, or collected without full
        context. If these issues are ignored, models may reinforce unfair
        outcomes or misleading conclusions. For example, algorithms used in
        hiring, education, or healthcare can affect people’s opportunities.
        This means data scientists must think critically about how data is
        collected, processed, and interpreted.

        At this point in the course, I believe using data about people comes with
        responsibilities such as respecting privacy, being transparent about
        methods, and acknowledging limitations in datasets. It is important to
        question assumptions and consider who might be impacted by a model’s
        results. Ethical data use is not optional; it is part of professional
        practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this course, I hope to better understand how data science fits
        into broader social and interdisciplinary contexts. I want to learn not
        only how to build effective technical solutions, but also how to evaluate
        their impact on society. Developing this awareness will help me become a
        more thoughtful and responsible data scientist in the future.
